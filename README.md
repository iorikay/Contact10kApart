# Contact10kApart
Project using Microsoft's contact XML format for the 10k Apart Contest
I've been working on XML projects since 1998. When I've discovered Windows 7 the first time, 
I was pleasantly surprised by the new Contact feature, and I knew it can become the base for more ambitious projects.
Because "contact" is the french for ignition. Sounds good to start your project, wherever you may go.
Whatever business application you design, you always need contacts.
These can be your client, or supplier in your accounting system.
They are your attorneys in you asset managment system, your employees, your companies or the opponent ones..

But to start with Contacts, a Who is Who is a perfect project
My company needed one urgently, so they outsourced it to our ECMS provider.
And we got a nice result based on their collection system, with a lot of jquery and Angular

But why not go straight to something simple and lighter ? 
Turn our Contacts into a pure HTML, CSS and Javascript application, in 10K, that's the challenges
